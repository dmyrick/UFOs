# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage of UFO sightings that included a dynamic table with filters for multiple criteria. The data in the table may be filtered by date, city, state, country, or shape.

## Results
The filtered table on the webpage allows users to input a city, state, or shape to gather information of possible sighting details. The following are examples of how the dynamic table could be used:

## Summary
The design of the webpage is functional. However, one drawback is that data is not updated as new UFO sightings are documented. Therefore, the data in the table is not current. The following are recommendations to improve the current built multiple criteria table and webpage:
  1. Link the table data to a current recorded UFO sightings webpage.
  2. Add additional countries to the UFO sighting data.
